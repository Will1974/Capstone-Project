The Problem
------------
The problem will be to find the nearest phone shop in a 1km radius of the Hilton Hotel in Brisbane City centre.
The address of the Hotel is:
190 Elizabeth St,
Brisbane City,
QLD 4000,
Australia

The Audience
------------
In this particular problem the audience would be guests staying at the hotel and hotel staff.
This will serve all customers that stay at the hotel that encounter phone problems and need replacement phones, Charger, and SIM cards.

Initially we will convert the Hotel address (190 Elizabeth St, Brisbane City QLD 4000) to longitude/Latitude coordinates.
We will build up a URL to invoke the Foursquare API containing search criteria for 'Phones'.

We will then apply some filtering to clean the data and finally diplay the results on a map.
