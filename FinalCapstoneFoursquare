The Problem
------------
The problem will be to find the nearest phone shop in a 1km radius of the Hilton Hotel in Brisbane City centre.

In this particular problem the audience would be guests staying at the hotel and hotel staff.
This will serve all customers that stay at the hotel that encounter phone problem and need replacement phones, Charger, and SIM cards.

We will start by converting the Hotel address (190 Elizabeth St, Brisbane City QLD 4000) to longitude/Latitude coordinates.
We will build up a URL to invoke the Foursquare API containing search criteria for 'Phones'.
The results returned from Foursquare API will be loaded into a dataframe.

We will then apply some filtering to clean the data and finally diplay the results on a map.


The data
---------
Initially we will use the Address to get the Longtitude/Latitude Coordinates.
The results returned from Foursquare API will be in json format. 
These results contain information such as Venues, Ratings and Items.
We will also invoke http://api.foursquare.com/v1/history to get the 'Checkin History' for the Venue.

All these results will be loaded into a Panda Dataframe. 
From here we will be able to do further data manipulations such as Normalising, Filtering and displaying on a Map.



Conclusion
-----------
From the results set in the map we can that there is only one store in the 1 km radius that has phones in the name.
This is apparent in both the data set as well as the Folium map also.
