The data
---------
Initially we will use the Address to get the Longtitude/Latitude Coordinates.
The results returned from Foursquare API will be in json format. 
These results contain information such as Venues, Ratings and Items.
We will also invoke http://api.foursquare.com/v1/history to get the 'Checkin History' for the Venue.

All these results will be loaded into a Panda Dataframe. 
From here we will be able to do further data manipulations such as Normalising, Filtering and displaying on a Map.
